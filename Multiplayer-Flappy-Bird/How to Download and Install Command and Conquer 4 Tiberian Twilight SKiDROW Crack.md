Command and Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight features a new gameplay system that differs from the previous games in the series. Instead of building a base and collecting resources, you have a mobile base called a Crawler that can deploy into different modes and produce units on the fly. You can also choose from three classes for each faction: Offense, Defense, and Support. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as unique units and abilities.
 
The game also features a persistent player progression system that allows you to unlock new units, upgrades, and abilities as you play. You can level up your profile across all game modes, including the campaign, co-operative, and multiplayer modes. The game also tracks your statistics and achievements online, and lets you customize your avatar and loadout.
 
The game's campaign mode consists of 14 missions that can be played solo or co-operatively with another player. The campaign follows the events of the year 2062, when Kane reveals his plan to use a Tiberium Control Network to stop the spread of Tiberium and save humanity. However, not everyone trusts Kane's motives, and a conflict erupts between GDI and Nod. The campaign has two storylines, one for each faction, that show different perspectives of the events.
 
The game's multiplayer mode is a 5v5 objective-based mode that requires teamwork and coordination. Each team has a base that can be attacked or defended by using units and abilities. The objective is to capture control nodes on the map that generate points for your team. The first team to reach a certain amount of points or destroy the enemy base wins the match.
