Manthrigam is not a new or modern phenomenon. It has a long and rich history that dates back to ancient times. According to some sources, manthrigam was first taught by Lord Shiva to his consort Parvati, who then passed it on to their son Murugan, who then taught it to his disciple Agastya, who then spread it to the rest of the world. Other sources claim that manthrigam was first revealed by Lord Vishnu to his devotee Narada, who then taught it to various sages and saints. Some of the most famous and influential manthrigam siddhars or masters are Agastya, Bogar, Thirumoolar, Goraknath, Patanjali, and Sivavakkiyar.
 
Manthrigam is not a monolithic or uniform system. It has many branches and variations that differ in their philosophy, methodology, and goals. Some of the major types of manthrigam are:

1. Vasiyam: This is the type of manthrigam that deals with attracting and influencing people. It is used for various purposes such as love, marriage, friendship, business, politics, etc. Vasiyam manthrigam uses various tools such as herbs, oils, powders, dolls, etc. to create a magnetic effect on the target person.
2. Kattu: This is the type of manthrigam that deals with binding and controlling people. It is used for various purposes such as revenge, domination, protection, etc. Kattu manthrigam uses various tools such as nails, threads, knots, locks, etc. to create a restrictive effect on the target person.
3. Pooja: This is the type of manthrigam that deals with worshiping and pleasing gods and goddesses. It is used for various purposes such as blessings, prosperity, health, happiness, etc. Pooja manthrigam uses various tools such as flowers, fruits, lamps, incense, etc. to create a devotional effect on the target deity.
4. Homam: This is the type of manthrigam that deals with offering and sacrificing fire and other substances. It is used for various purposes such as purification, transformation, liberation, etc. Homam manthrigam uses various tools such as firewood, ghee, rice, etc. to create a sacrificial effect on the target element.

These are some of the common types of manthrigam that are practiced by many people around the world. However, there are also other types of manthrigam that are more rare and secretive, such as kundalini manthrigam, siddha manthrigam, moola manthrigam, etc. These types of manthrigam are more advanced and esoteric and require a higher level of initiation and guidance from a qualified guru.
